Ingredients:
 - 7 packets Jelly: Grape (purple)
 - Creaming Soda (pink)
 - Blueberry (blue)
 - Lime (green)
 - Lemon (yellow)
 - Orange (orange)
 - Raspberry (red)

Directions:
1. Prepare a ring jelly mould by spaying lightly with canola spray.
2. It's tasteless and will assist in the removal of jelly at completion.
3. Follow directions to prepare the first jelly colour(purple) in a jug and fill approximately 1/7th of the mould. This doesn¡¦t need to be science, an estimation is fine!
4. Place a lid on your mould or cover with cling film and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or until firmly set.
5. When the first layer is set, prepare the second jelly colour (pink).
6. Pour another 1/7th of the mould over the purple jelly, cover and return to the refrigerator to set.
7. Repeat this process for each colour, to achieve a ¡¥true rainbow¡¦ pour the jelly in the colour order listed in the ingredients list.
8. When the last layer (red) has set completely, remove the lid/cover and place the plate or platter you wish to serve the rainbow on top of the mould, face down.
9. It is a good idea to ensure the plate or platter is approximately 20 per cent wider than the mould.
10. Invert the mould holding plate or platter in place, so the mould sits on top of the plate.
11. Remove the centre part of the mould. The jelly will flop onto your plate or platter.
12. Cut a slice in the bottom centre portion of the jelly, then carefully extend from the cuts outward to form a rainbow shape.
13. Slice and serve with your favourite fruit or icecream ¡V a party hit!
